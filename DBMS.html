          Data :
          <br>
            Data refers to raw facts, figures, observations, or information that
            can be processed or used for various purposes, especially in
            computing. Data can be in the form of numbers, text, images, or
            other formats, and it often serves as the foundation for analysis,
            decision-making, and communication. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Information :
          <br>
            Information can be seen as processed or organized data that has been
            given meaning and context. It is the result of interpreting,
            analyzing, or organizing data in a meaningful way. Unlike raw data,
            which can be unorganized and difficult to interpret directly,
            information is structured and relevant to its intended use or
            purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meta Data :
          <br>      Metadata refers to data that provides information about other data.
            It describes various aspects of data, such as its content,
            structure, format, location, ownership, and usage. Metadata is
            commonly used to facilitate the understanding, management, and
            organization of data.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          Data dictionary :
          <br>
            A data dictionary is a centralized repository of metadata about the
            data within a database or dataset. It provides detailed descriptions
            of the structure, format, semantics, and relationships of the data
            elements or attributes. Essentially, a data dictionary serves as a
            reference guide that helps users understand and interpret the
            meaning and characteristics of the data.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          Database :
          <br>
            A database is a structured repository where data is organized and
            stored electronically within a computer system. It serves as a
            centralized mechanism to efficiently manage, manipulate, retrieve,
            and update large volumes of related data. Databases are essential
            components in computing, facilitating the structured storage of
            information across various applications and systems. 
          
        </li>

        <li>
          Table :
          <br>
            A table is a fundamental organizational structure used to store and
            manage data in a structured format. Tables are part of relational
            databases, which are among the most common types of databases used
            today. Each table in a relational database consists of rows (also
            known as records or tuples) and columns (also known as fields or
            attributes). 
          
        </li>
        <li>
          Tuple :
          <br>
            A tuple refers to a single row or record within a table that
            contains a set of related data elements. Tuples are fundamental
            units of data storage and organization in relational databases,
            where they represent individual instances or entries of
            information.In summary, tuples in databases serve as the primary
            means of organizing and representing individual data entries within
            tables. 
          
        </li>
        <li>
          Domain :
          <br>
            In the context of databases and data management, a domain refers to
            the set of possible values that a data element (or attribute) can
            contain. It defines the permissible range of values that a specific
            column in a table can hold, based on its data type and any
            constraints applied to it.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          Key :
          <br>
            A "key" refers to a special attribute or set of attributes that
            uniquely identify a tuple (row) within a table. Keys play a
            fundamental role in relational database design and management,
            ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient data
            retrieval.Keys are crucial for maintaining data integrity,
            facilitating data relationships (through foreign keys), and
            optimizing query performance in relational databases.
